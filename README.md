## Unit 3 Project: List Pagination and Filtering

**Summary:** This project uses JavaScript & jQuery to add extra functionality to the form, making it easier to use.  It follows progressive enhancement principles so the form still works at a basic level when JavaScript is disabled.  Lastly, it uses JavaScript to validate the form in real-time and when a user tries to submit the form.
